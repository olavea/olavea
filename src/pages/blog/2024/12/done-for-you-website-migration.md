![shark and team member](looney-the-portal-is-not-there.png)

Your website is stuck on a reef in the sharky waters of the World Wide Web. A migrating is needed, BUT it will bring some of your best team members in contact with those sharks. Sharky meetings, sharky internal discussions about unimportant, but still controversial priotitazions maybe even sharky design questions. In short, you might not know everything about HOW website migration will go about. But you DO know a migration is going to be more of a HASSLE than you need right now.

## Imagine looking back on your website migration with a smile
