I've always been a pirate. I've known no other life. As a boy I adored tall tales, if I saw a pirate I HAD to go and chat. My father worked on a sailing ship in the harbour downtown Oslo so I saw plenty of pirates. You know, tattos, unshaved thick necks. A gold tooth glinting from a piraty grin. The tales they told of derring do, guts and glory...

So my first blood-in-the-water experience came as no shock to me. I was 11 or 12. And after the fight I watched my dad patch up that bleeding sailor with duct tape.

Every time I'm at the downtown harbour I see that sailing ship where the fight happened. That ship always makes me smile. The ship's shape is like a hollywood dierctor's dream of a pirate ship. I'll know it if you see it. A big box on the butt end with big windows. We were up there on the box in the sunshine, looking down on the raucous summer party, my dad and me. The party goers were the crews of several neighbouring ships. Drinks were free and in Scandinavia free drinks equals heavy drinking. A handful sailors were jumping into the sea.

A wet sailor climbed up to us on the aft deck. Not a big dude, but we could see his muscles. And he was wide. His grin was also wide. He pointed at the man beside me. I looked up. And up. THIS was a big man, he smiled back at the smaller man.

"YOU need a bath." Said the smaller man still pointing and I just KNEW. "This is a coming fight". I wasn't fighting daily at school myself, but it was a close thing most weeks. I had developed a feel for a coming fight. A sort of tingle. I remember feeling the tingle and thinking "You've got NO chance little guy."

The big guy spread his feet and crouched low. My father pulled me away by my arm. A few slaps of wet feet and the two men had magically moved to the hip high fence. A quick shuffle and the big man was airborn, outside the fence. The big man's long arm snaked out and grasped the back of the head of the smaller man. Two men spun in the air like toys.

I heard the tinkle of glass, but I have no memory of the foot crashing through the big window below us in the box. I quess I wasn't fast enough to the railing to see, probably my father still held my arm. But the smaller man swimming I saw. Swimming calmly, blood spurting out his right ankle in clouds. I remember thinking of sharks, but no sharks came.

When the bleeding sailor climbed on deck my father stood ready with the duct tape. I still stood on the aft deck as I was told. Dad just wrapped the duct tape around and around the sailor's ankle, lower leg and foot. Saying into the silence "not too tight, noot too loose." Nobody else made a sound.

The injured sailor was still smiling, what a trouper! The big guy was NOT smiling. Soon I could see the two men shrinking in the rubber dinghy on their way to the emergency room. By then the music was back on, along with the party.
