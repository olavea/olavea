		8 step

	</p>

	<p>
		One way to get ReFocused is to talk to the right person at the right time. About your situation, YOUR personality, your kid and YOUR parenting goals.
		It sounds complex. To you, but to ME it comes down to only one list of priorities in your life. 
		And I say "Only ONE Priority Can Be Number 1". That number 1 priority is where you'll
		get your parenting ReFocused. 
	</p>

	<p>
 Finally, we agree to a set of tactics that fit your personality and family.
		First steps Let go Get
		Every unfocused family is different
		back in time to when you felt in control
		And it's easier for me to see what is less important in your parenting, because I'm not YOU. I'm not involved, I'm just listening to you.
