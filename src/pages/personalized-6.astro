	<ul>
		<li>I‚Äôve been a dad for more than 10 years, I feel your pain</li>
		<li>I have delivered 100+ hours of coaching to folks like you</li>
		<li>I am a dev like you</li>
		<li>I am a digital druggie, but my parenting game is Focused.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<h3>Here‚Äôs How It Works:</h3>

	<p>		
		Our treasuremapping session will take place over Zoom. Calls typically take 60-90 minutes, but we‚Äôll block out 2 hours just in case. You are welcome to record the call for future reference.

		On our call, we first define the current state of your parenting. 
		
		Then we identify your parenting goals and the road blocks preventing you from reaching them.
		
		After that we get a grip on your personality type and how you can leverage your strengths in parenting. 
		During our call I will tak notes in a bullet point list.
		Then we'll go through that list and give each bullet a numbered priority.
		There can only be ONE number one priority on your parenting list. 
		This is the skill you'll focus on building. Yeah I know 
		I haven't talked about skill-building before now, but that is what you'll be doing.
		This whole parenting thing boils down to two things:
	</p>
	
	</ul>
		<li>Picking ONE parenting skill and </li>
		<li>Using scentifically proven methods building that ONE parenting skill.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p>
		Since you're a Developer many of these skill-building methods will be familiar to you, but
		the key is sticking those methods and more importantly STICKING to your ONE parenting skill.
		Because the most method of skill-building that scentifically shows most significant results is sticking to ONE skill over time.
		Do you see now how this reFocused Parenting can be doable for you? Prioritizing a list and building a skill, this is 
		NOT Rocket Surgery is it?! You've got this! 
	</p>			

	<p>
		Usually we end up with a handful of
		priorities and it comes down to a choice, made by you. But because I'm there with you, you'll 
		come out in the other end with 
	</p>

	</ul>
		<li>One parenting skill and </li>
		<li>One first step to build that skill.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p>
		You'll also have your list of:
	</p> 
	
	</ul>
		<li>road blocks and distractions and the signs to look for</li> 
		<li>to stay away from them.</li>
		
	</ul>
	<br />
