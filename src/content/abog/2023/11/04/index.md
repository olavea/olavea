## Future ideas

- Should consumer be able to edit?
- Maybe edit and listen looks similar and you play episodes from both
- Adding auth could let you be more personal in the notes
- Select clips from the episode to add, instead of full episode - On the web very possible, [but also possible to transform the audio file and create new file](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_trimming_and_concatenating)
- Remix a MixPod?
- AI Sentiments capture to create cover image

[Could we do AI clips?](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/ai_in_action#ai_based_highlights)
