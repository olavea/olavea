# creating an HTML element

Today I created an HTML element with `document.createElement()` .

```js
const myParagraph = document.createElement("p");
console.log(myParagraph);
```

And later I used an API called appendChild to add `myParagraph` to the page.

Wes Bos told me to be careful because:

> Everytime you use appendChild() you are modifying the DOM, which causes something called a reflow in the browser, which tells the browser that something has changed and that the browser needs to repaint the HTML.
