# Be a lady or a gent and DON'T set an Attribute that is non standard

you shouldn't try `setAttribute` . Because your non Standard Attribute is BAD news for a future HTML Standard Attribute with the same name.

Then you would end up having to travel back in time and trick yourself into not setting that is non standard Attribute. Or you'll have legacy code that is clashing with the standards which will lead to bugs.
