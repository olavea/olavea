## Not sure how to fix your dev problem?

Unexpected bugs pop up in your project. You have Googled. You have looked through Stack Overflow. You don't know what your next step is

## Imagine your project working properly

Imagine this â€“ Imagine your project following best practices

## An expert code review will get you unstuck


## Here's How It Works

- In a virtual 30-minute meeting, you present your project and the underlying challenges you are having. If you are not the lead developer, bring the lead developer!

- After that, you give me access to your code, and
- I thoroughly go through the whole code base.

After I finish the go-through, we schedule a one-hour review session where I present my "pull request" to your project. It's not a real pull request, you'll have to copy paste my code and work on it. But there will be a golden nugget in there that is one of the keys to your solution.

You are free to record this session for future reference.
