lead: You have been building your Gatsby skills for a while now. You have maybe built a few paid projects with Gatsby. But you are still stuck in the "good zone". Your clients might not notice, but you KNOW you are not great. And you don't like it.

## Imagine knowing exactly what ONE Gatsby skill YOU should nail down first

Imagine this – Imagine knowing exactly what ONE Gatsby skill to nail first. Imagine seeing how the next Gatsby skill you nail is the start of your Great Gatsby skill-builder ship. Imagine having the confidence that the ONE Gatsby skill you are building really is the one YOU should focus on.

## Get a personalized plan from a seasoned Gatsby skill-builder coach

Get Unstuck – Often, all it takes to get unstuck from the "good zone" is to talk to the right person at the right time. A person who has experience with skill-builder journeys that are similar to yours. A person who is building his own Great Gatsby skill-builder ship together with fellow Gatsby-devs.

## Here's How It Works

You book an Emergency Gatsby Call with me using [my scheduling link](https://savvycal.com/raae/emergency). The event is 60 minutes, but you might want to block out extra time in case we go a little long. Our call will take place over Whereby. When booking, I'll ask you to give me a quick rundown of your troubles and your tech stack.

### 100% Money back guarantee

If I cannot help you find a way to get off your reef, I'll refund your payment in full.

### Availability is limited

I'm only available for a couple live Gatsby calls per week. Scheduling is first-come, first-served, so the sooner you book your call, the sooner you'll get into clear waters again.
