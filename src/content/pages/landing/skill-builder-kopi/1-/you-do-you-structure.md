(Introduction)

do 3 sess

Ola starts today's Skill-Builder-Session by pointing at his dev-self in the mirror, saying with his Captain-in-a-storm-in-the-North-Sea-voice:

Â«SELF! Structure today's Skill-Builder-Session to fit YOUR dev-brain or your Half-Assed-Structure sets-up your Skill-Builder-Ship to become Half-Assed.Â»

1. TODO:
   Make up your mind, if Â«yesÂ» say Â«Yo-HO! Yo-Ho! Let's GO!Â»
   Start a count-down timer with X minutes. Ola uses 96 minutes, but you do you.
   Go to 2. and start your next Skill-Builder-Session by structuring it to fit YOUR dev-brain.

If Â«noÂ» replace Â«familyÂ» with somebody who is meaningful to you and who your behavior has some kind of impact on, for example Â«best friendÂ» or Â«sisterÂ» or Â«colleaugeÂ» or Â«neighbourÂ».
Think to yourself Â«SELF! Structure your Skill-Builder-Session & your life will be worthwhiler and your family will benefit from you having a worthwhiler life! Or the opposite will be true.Â»
How does it feel? If you fell nothing this is not for you. Sorry ðŸ˜º.

2. Crocodile-Count
   Ola draws a Â«!Â» for each time today's task is done: !!!!. ..... Until the Crocodile-clock goes: RR!

3. TODO:
   Find an old notebook, grab a pen and draw 8 dots. Like this: ..... ...
   Later you add a Â«IÂ» to one dot turning it into a Â«!Â» for each time today's task is done.

4. Question and Answer
   What's the point with the Crocodile-Count?

5. Taskerbell-Task
   A practice exercise Structured for YOU to take a Â«fine-grainedÂ» dev-task from unreliable coding to 96% reliablility.

6. TODO:
   Why not take a tiny bit of a dev-task you've already finished at work?
   Much, much tinier than you think, maybe.
   Write your tiny Taskerbell-Task in that old notebook you found.
   Or write here: \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_
   Start doing your dev-task, but go slow.
   Don't read on, it's time to act! If you delay your Skill-Builder-Ship will decay.
   Breath in deeply with your nose and let the air go out of your mouth by it self.

7. Question and Answer
   What does Â«fine-grainedÂ» mean ... ?
   What does 96% reliablility mean ... ?
   What does Â«tinyÂ» mean?. Ola means Â«tinyÂ» as in the tiny bells Tinkerbell has on her shoes In the first Peter Pan cartoon by Disney. Don't remember seeing those tiny bells on Tinkerbell's shoes? Well there you go! That's how tiny Ola means.

After your first Structured Skill-Builder-Session
and before your second Session read A. - B. - C. But don't do the TODOs, just keep them Â«in the back of your brain.Â»

A. How Did YOU Automate
in your skull that tiny Taskerbell-Task? One way Ola finds out is to log every Session -> log book.

A. TODO:
Write notes in that old notebook you found. You know, just write down stuff that pops into your brain. For each word you write down you Â«make spaceÂ» for another word in your brain. If you keep writing down words while you code one of those words might be a golden nugget, showing you the path you need to take to Automate in your skull this tiny Taskerbell-Task.

A. Question and Answer
What does Â«Automate in your skull Â» mean ... ?

B. Who's your accountability-Buddy, Buddy?
Find a proper PIRATE, playfuller than you an UN-let-downable, like Lillian is to Ola.

B. TODO:
Write names in that old notebook you found. You know, just write down names that pops into your brain. For each name you write down you Â«make spaceÂ» for another name in your brain. If you keep writing down names while you code one of those words might be a golden nugget, showing you who you need to make your accountability-Buddy

B. Question and Answer
What's an accountability-Buddy? ....
What does a good accountability-Buddy look like? ....
What does a bad accountability-Buddy look like? ....
How do you approach an accountability-Buddy?

C. When do you Celebrate?
Pick a number like 3. Count your Skill-Builder-Sessions. Celebrate your win with your Buddy.

C. TODO:
Celebrate with or without your Buddy.
Sharing is caring send me an email about your Celebration, would you? ðŸ˜º

C. Question and Answer
What's the point with Celebration?
How do you Celebrate?

1. Start a count-down timer with X minutes

1. TODO:
   Make up your mind Â«yesÂ» or Â«noÂ» to start structuring today's Skill-Builder-Session, if Â«yesÂ» start a count-down timer with X minutes. Ola uses 96 minutes, but you do you.

1. Reps, reps, reps: Crocodile-Count your reps

1. TODO:
   Find an old notebook, grab a pen and draw 8 dots. Like this: ..... ...
   Or print out this work-sheet.
   Later you add a Â«IÂ» to one dot turning it into a Â«!Â» for each time today's task is done.

1. Your Taskerbell-Task is Tiny

1. TODO:
   Why not take a tiny tidbit of a dev-task you've already finished at work? Tinier than you think, maybe.
   Write your tiny Taskerbell-Task in that old notebook you found.
   Or print out this work-sheet and write here: \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_
