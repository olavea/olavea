## Not sure how to debug your skill-builder-sessions in your dev-job?

Are you lost on your skill-builder treasure hunt? Do you find yourself doing a dev-task again and even though it's just a month since last time you still need to re-solve that same dev-task?

### Imagine KNOWING «This skill-builder-session actually worked!»

Imagine this – Imagine finishing your skill-builder-session and KNOWING «this dev-task is now automated in my brain». Imagine FEELING that dev-task-success again and again and again. Imagine adding link after link after golden link to the anchor chain of your most treasured dev-skill.

Or imagine doing a skill-builder-session and finding that ONE bug in your brain and saying to yourself «Self! You know how to debug that brain-bug!». And imagine debugging THAT brain-bug on the fly. And imagine finishing THAT buggy skill-builder-session and still knowing «this dev-task is now automated in my brain».

Imagine knowing how to set up your skill-builder-session in a way that let's your brain do what it loves to do. Your brain KNOWS how to automate one dev-task. And your brain LOVES to horde a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks. That is what one dev-skill is, a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks.

Your brain LOVES to horde a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks. Your brain is part pirate captain, that way. Ever since your brain lived inside your drooling baby-pirate skull your brain has been a super duper skill-builder treasure hunter. All you have to do is to avoid wrecking your skill-builder-ship on your brain-bugs.

### Let's map over YOUR brain-bugs for YOUR skill-builder treasure hunt

Debug your brain-bugs – Sometimes it's easier for somebody else to see your brain bugs for what they are than it is for you. Here is a picture, your skill-builder-ship is an tiny pirate ship model inside a bottle. Your brain bugs are written on the label outside the bottle. It's easier for somebody else to read the brain bugs on the label from the outside than it is for you to read from the inside of the bottle.

Am I often exhausted on this day in my cycle? Was it this exact day last cycle I also wanted a divorce? When should I book those sales meetings?

### Knowledge is power!

I have learned not to make any drastic changes when I am #mollefonk. I tell myself if you still feel this way in two days, let's talk.

A friend cannot sell while menstruating, but on the other hand, they are a selling machine when ovulating.

**POW!** does not make any guesses for you, it lets you know what you have tagged before, on the same cycle day.

You might not always be able to plan around your cycle. But knowing that feeling exhausted on cycle day 14 is expected, you can at least skip the added stress of thinking there is a reason and trying to find a solution.
