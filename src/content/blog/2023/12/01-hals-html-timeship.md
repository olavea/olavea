Halloo!

The Hero

tale isn't
me, it's my boss Lotta.

A story's supposed
to have a start.
Sorry about
that, but I
NEED to tell
you today, because ... you'll see.

A long time ago, on a bridge
far, far away
....

Lotta & I woke to
banging on
our door.
«Ah, it's you.»
I let in the
Blacks, from
two houses down.

«Our Lucy sent us a letter.»
Said mr Black.
«That's good.»
I Said. Mrs
Black sat down
on the floor, bawling her eyes out.

"Look, there's
another letter
attached." Said
mrs Black and
I reached
for it.

"Hal!" Lotta
shouted.
"Put the
kettle on,
that's a
dear." Lotta thinks I rub some
people the wrong way sometimes, like now.

"Why'd the
Blacks come to
Lotta & me
with that
ransom note?"
you ask.

We are
Detectives,
Lotta

Pirate
Detectives.

the Blacks
ginger cookies
as they
told us
their
tearful tale.

How little Lucy
went out
to do a
morning
delivery of chocolate
croissants, never
to be seen again.

«Leave
it
with
us.»
Lotta
said.

«We'll
find
this Treasure Map
of these
so-called
'Web-Dev'
Islands &

<!-- ![Web-Dev-Islands-1]() -->

we'll set
up an
exchange,
don't
you
worry.»

<!-- ![exchange-Hal]() -->

«YESS!
We've got a
new CASE!»
Said Hal
when we
were
alone.

<!-- ![a-case-Hal]() -->

«And a
TOUGH
one.» Said
Lotta.
Thoughtfully
tapping her
sharp right
front tooth.

<!-- ![sharp-tooth-Hal]() -->

«So what's
our next
move boss?»
Said Hal.
«Have you
ever heard
of these 'Web-
Dev Islands?» Said Lotta.

<!-- ![web-Dev-Islands-2]() -->

«Not a pip, but
why should I have?
The whole
PLACE
sounds
insanely
illegal. "web-dev"! It's pure Treason , innit.» Hal said.

<!-- ![web-Dev-Islands-3]() -->

«Yeah .... Let's go have some egg & bacon breakfast down at the Dolphin and see what gossip we can pick up about these 'Web-Dev Islands'.» I said

So Hal and I popped into the Dodgy Dolphin for a spot of breakfast. As always there was a loud group of musicians and actors drinking at the bar. We ignored them and went to the fireplace. A handfull of sailors were sitting close to the roaring fire. I say "sailors", but they were proper pirates. We knew them from the "Tarquin Todd case" last summer.

Hal & I brought the pirates a round of grog and a piece of paper with my sketchnoted Web-Dev Islands Treasure Map. Hal & I ate our bacon'n eggs in silence. It's a mistake to ask a question off of a pirate, she'll clam up. But shut up yourself and a pirate will start chatting like a magpie. Can't help herself. Silence is torture to a pirate. Uncle Walsingham told us that.

A hard looking redhead slammed her empty grog on the table.

«Yall heard the one about how ol'Cap'n Crook aaaalmost lost BOTH his hands?» She whispered huskily and pulled a great wad of chewing tobacco out of her upper jaw. I've heard several versions, but I wasn't worried because the tales were all GREAT.

«He wasnae old back then our Cap'n Crook. A beardless cook boy he was. We were boarding a french frigate in the Biscay. Totally legit mind you, we HAD the paperwork. The weather turned treacherous, slapping our ship around. Next thing Captain Pan hisself was down in the drink. Captain Pan floating around unconscious, helpless as a babe in a Bahamas jungle! Young Crook jumped right in after. And wouldn't you know it a shark showed up instantly. Some say Crook had read about the trick in a book, but anyway the boy punched that shark straight in the snout. The shark gave Crook an insulted stare to the count'o 10. Crook though, didn't blink. The boy stared right back into that sharky eye, holding his guard up lika pro. That gave the crew juuuust time enough to hoist Captain Pan» Said .

«.» Said .
«.» I said
«.» Said Hal.
