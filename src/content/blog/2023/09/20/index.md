Our Data in the Wild podcast is starting back up again after the summer holidays.

We have six good episodes wrapped up and I am exited to do the last four interviews.

We've started nudging our favourite devs to book their recording times. All four have said "yes", so it's a matter of time before ....

We have two names you might recognize, Swizeck Teller the Hemigway of data models and Jack Ellis of Fathom. We also have two shiny, new names.

Dan which we met at a conference in Athens, Greece. Where Dan said in his talk, "all data models are wrong, but some are useful"

And Ivar Conradi Østhus which you may meet this Friday. Ivar is the Cheif Technology Officer of the feature flagging company getunleashed.com

If you have an idea for what I should write in one of the bubbles, tell me. Use the red numbers on pink.
