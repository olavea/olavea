Intentional practice (also known as deliberate practice) is the Big Daddy
of getting better, and the focus of this book. When you practiceâ€”or
playâ€”with focused intent on improving, your progress is much more
rapid.
Weâ€™re going to dig deeply into all three of these kinds of practice for the
rest of the book, but weâ€™ll give extra attention to intentional practice,
because itâ€™s the best way to improve quickly. With these techniques,
youâ€™ll continue to improve at what you love for the rest of your life.
You ready?
