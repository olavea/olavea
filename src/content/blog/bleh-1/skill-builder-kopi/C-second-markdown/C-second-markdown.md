D. Don't Show Goodies to Fox and maybe get bitten

1. Pick your only-skill-builder-skill and promise to stick to building that skill in the coming weeks:

2. Write down ideas for 2 sub-skills of your only-skill-builder-skill. Pick one sub-skill:

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ _ and _ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

3. Plan 3 skill-builder-sessions: Day: \_ \_ \_ _ Time: _ \_ \_ _ Day: _ \_ \_ _ Time: _ \_ \_ _ Day: _ \_ \_ _ Time: _ \_ \_ \_

4. 42 minutes count down, get started with your first skill-builder-session and work with the tiniest task imaginable for you. You are doing it right if you are able to automate in your brain the work you do in you skill-builder-session of between 42 minutes and 96 minutes.

After a while: Add a few of these skill-builder-session-tips if you want to

B. Brainy automation: automate in your brain the work you do in each skill-builder-session.
U. Un-barr barriers: Take notes about your personal barriers that stop or distract you from skill-building. The notes in themselves will have a tiny positive effect in un-barring your barriers. But don't fight back. Yet.

I. Important motivation: building something that is important to somebody else while you are building your skill is a good idea for LATER. So take notes of ideas for "somebodies" and "somethings" that can be important. Call your list for example "Good ideas for LATER" and look at it often for motivation. Decide that you won't make decisions about this in several weeks. Remember you're a skill-builder now, you can be a SKILLED builder some other time.
L. Loopy feedback: Create fast feedback loops.
D. Dedicate time: Dedicate time for your skill-builder-sessions.

E. Egg clock: Keep your skill-builder-sessions between 42 minutes and 96 minutes. Short and sweet.
R. Right tools: The right tool could be 1/2 the work of building your only-skill-builder-skill. Certainly the "slightly-wrong-tool" could harm your skill-building.
