Sawdust:
Find a place you can be alone with a mirror. Point at your dev-self in the mirror and say with your Captain voice: «SELF! Structure your Skill-Builder-Session & your life will be worthwhiler and your family will benefit from you having a worthwhiler life! Or the opposite will be true.»

later in nurture:
«SELF! Structure today's Skill-Builder-Session to fit YOUR dev-brain or your Half-Assed-Structure sets-up your Skill-Builder-Ship to become Half-Assed your work-life will become less worthwhile and your family
will be robbed of the happy moments your badass-you could have given them if you quit with your half-assery already.»

having a less worthwhiler life! Or the opposite will be true.

Don't read on, it's time to act! If you delay your Skill-Builder-Ship will decay.
Don't read on, it's time to act!
Breath in deeply with your nose and let the air go out of your mouth by it self.
