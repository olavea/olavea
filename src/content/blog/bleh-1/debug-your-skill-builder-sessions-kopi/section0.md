## Not sure how to debug your skill-builder-sessions in your dev-job?

### Imagine thinking «THAT brain-bug is the reason why this skill-builder-session is NOT working properly!»

Imagine this – Imagine doing a skill-builder-session and finding that ONE bug in your brain and saying to yourself «Self! You know that brain-bug!». And imagine debugging THAT brain-bug on the fly. And imagine finishing THAT buggy skill-builder-session and still saying to yourself «Self! Today's dev-task is now automated in my brain».

Your brain KNOWS how to automate one dev-task. And your brain LOVES to horde a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks. That is what one dev-skill is, a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks.

Your brain LOVES to horde a treasure trove of automated dev-tasks. Your brain was part pirate captain, that way. Back in the day when your brain lived inside your drooling baby-pirate skull your brain was a super duper skill-builder treasure hunter. All you have to do to take a trip back in time and let your brain BE piraty again is to avoid wrecking your skill-builder-ship. One brain-bug at a time.

### Let's log YOUR brain-bugs and turn YOUR skill-builder-session into a brain-bug treasure hunt

Log your brain-bugs – Sometimes it's easier to identify your brain bug if you've logged that brain-bug before. And Sometimes it's easier to identify your brain-bug if you've written down WHAT to look for in your own behavior for each brain-bug YOU most commonly crash into on your skill-builder-trips.

Here is a picture, see your skill-builder-ship is an tiny pirate ship-model inside a bottle. Your own behavior for each brain-bug is are written on the label outside the bottle. This is unfortunate, because you are inside the bottle, at the helm, steering your skill-builder-ship. Even if you use really expensive binocólars it is hard for you to read the label from the inside. It's easier for somebody else to read the label from the outside than it is for you to read from the inside of the bottle.

Am I often exhausted on this day in my cycle? Was it this exact day last cycle I also wanted a divorce? When should I book those sales meetings?

### Knowledge is power!

I have learned not to make any drastic changes when I am #mollefonk. I tell myself if you still feel this way in two days, let's talk.

A friend cannot sell while menstruating, but on the other hand, they are a selling machine when ovulating.

**POW!** does not make any guesses for you, it lets you know what you have tagged before, on the same cycle day.

You might not always be able to plan around your cycle. But knowing that feeling exhausted on cycle day 14 is expected, you can at least skip the added stress of thinking there is a reason and trying to find a solution.
