## Not sure how to fix your Gatsby problem?


## Imagine your Gatsby working


## An expert code review will get you unstuck


## Here's How It Works

- In a virtual 30-minute meeting, you present your Gatsby project and the underlying challenges you are having. If you are not the lead developer, bring the lead developer!

- After that, you give me access to your code, and
- I thoroughly review the whole code base.

After I finish the review, we schedule a one-hour review session where I present my "pull request" to your Gatsby project. It's not a real pull request, you'll have to copy paste my code and work on it. But there will be a golden nugget in there that is one of the keys to your solution.

You are free to record this session for future reference.
