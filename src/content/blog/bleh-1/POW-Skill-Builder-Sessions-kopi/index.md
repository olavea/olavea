I went out on a skiing trip with my piraty friends

Here are two of them and in the background is a tribute to Theseus Ship, more about that some other time.

We started high up in the woods where the snow was good. We stopped at a cabin for coffe and baked goodies. The Cabin is called Ullev√•lseter.

We skied all the way down to the docks where the snow was juuuust passable. And there we met up with another old piraty friend "Uncle Miltiades".

"Uncle Miltiades" bought me a salmon salad and brought a great pirate pie we had with our espressos.

I asked "Uncle Miltiades" where he had hid Theseus' old pasSword. He wouldn't tell me, but I know he took it. And I suspect he is going to use it to make himself tyrant of Athens back in the 480s before Christ.
