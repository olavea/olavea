QUEEN [@raae](https://x.com/raae) and I have noticed The Pirate Princess (9) preferring to know what's going to happen, before it happens. Since then we've been doing family councils and last week I had something new for the Pirate Princess (9):

«You wanna help me migrate our POW! website?» I said.

«What does 'migrate' mean anyway?» Asked the lil' Pirate.

«A good question, I'll show ya! Then you'll decide if you wanna help me.» I said.

«Ok.»

So I started letting her play around with the Tailwind background colors on my blog. You know, to get into it. We sat together on our orange couch with my laptop. She looked for "bg" in my Visual Studio Code. Then guesses the english spelling of "orange" and "yellow"

The Pirate Princess (9) loved getting the background colors she wanted. Just like Captain Allister had suggested at the gym.

Notes for next part:
She experimented with the shades using numbers
