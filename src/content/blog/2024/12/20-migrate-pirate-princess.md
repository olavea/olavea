The other day QUEEN [@raae](https://x.com/raae) and I noticed The Pirate Princess preferring to know what's going to happen, before it happens. Since then we've been doing weekly family councils and last week I had something new for the Pirate Princess (9):

«You wanna help me migrate our POW! website?» I said.

«YES! What does 'migrate' mean anyway?» Asked the lil' Pirate.

«A good question, I'll show ya!» I said.

«Ok. Let's GOOO!»

## Playing around with background colors

So I started by letting her play around with the background colors on my blog. Using Tailwind classes. You know, to get into it. We sat together on our orange couch with my laptop. She looked for "bg" in my Visual Studio Code. Then guessed the english spelling of "orange" and "yellow", which where the colors she most frequently chose.

The Pirate Princess (9) loved getting the background colors she wanted. Just like Captain Allister had suggested to me at the gym. She experimented with the shades using numbers.

«How do you make that yellow go darker and darker like that?» Said The Pirate Princess 🏴‍☠️👸 (9).

«Just copy/paste THAT and chose your color like you're used to.» I said.

«So what about the POW! website?» Said the Pirate Princess.

«I'll show you the old and the new POW! website. Side by side and you'll tell me where they're different.» I said.

«Those letters are too fat.» The Pirate Princess points at the `<p>` text.

She's right, but when I change it to `font-light` she says:

«Now the letters are too thin.»

«I'll fix that later.» Shouted from the living room where she was drinking wine with a friend.
