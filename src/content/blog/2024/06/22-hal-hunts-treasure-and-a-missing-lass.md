Only in nightmares

has [hal][] ever been so

squashed & pressed

by other people.

Faces loom up

and flash by

singing, laughing,

drunken. Gone in

a dizzing whirl

of colour. [hal][]

swallows, blinks,

his head spins.

«Surely this IS

a nightmare.»

[hal][] mumbles.

[hal][] tails Sneaky

Rat-Face through

The singing,

the clapping

the crush, the joy

and confusion.

[hal][] has people on every side,

pushing,

jostling,

singing.

Hundreds of them.

«Move!» A shoulder

knocks [hal][] roughly

aside and is gone.

hide inside a

parrot stall.

«Ahoy [hal][]. Out

stalking again» Whispers

Parrot-Paulie.

«Good day to you

Parrot-Paulie. See

you later at

the concert.» Whispers

Whispers [hal][].

Lotta takes

over the tail,

she dances and slides

through the busteling

crowds.

«Sausage-inna-waffle!

Real beef. Hot

sausage-inna-waffle!»

«Drums! Tambourins!»

«Mieouw-

Miiieoooouuuw!»

«Oi! Lotta

I gotta get

this kitty down off

the wall.» [hal][]

whispers.

«Don't dawdle

Sneako

Ratface

might BE

Ellen's kidnapper.»

Lotta hisses back.

«But where's our Ratface

gone to?» [hal][] has a good

view of the street ahead,

all the way past

their own house.

No Sneako

Ratface in sight.

[hal][] climbs up

the wall of the house

in no time. «I've saved

kitties from here

before. You'll be

safe inside my pocket,

[hal][] quikly climbs

down and sprints

to Lotta.

«Gone?»

Whispers [hal][].

«Yeah. Gone inside

a house maybe?»

Whispers Lotta.

«Drat! I'll check

our house.» [hal][]

whispers.

«Oh yeah, forgot

to lock our door

again?» Lotta

whispers.

«Did NOT.» [hal][]

whispers.

«Did TOO.» Lotta

whispers.

«Nope. You're the

one who lost

him.» [hal][]

whispers.

«Well our door IS

unlocked

...» Lotta

whispers.

They sneak inside,

[hal][] hand signals

for each of them

to go in through

a separate kitchen door.

«ALARM! THIEF!» [hal][]

hollers towards the

open door, knowing

his voice will carry

outside. Ratface

whirls to face Hal.

«Hah! You boy! You

and me then.»

«Others will come

Ratface, The

neighbourhood watch.»

Hal walks confidently towards Sneako.

Ratface smiles with

yellow teeth and

a clawlike blade

glints in his left

hand.

The kitten rears

it's orange head hissing

Sneako

stumbles

3 steps back and goes

down right over Lotta's

leg sweep.

Lotta grips

Ratface's knifehand and

headlocks

Ratface's neck and arm.

«GAH!» Ratface drops

his curved knife with

a tinkle.

«I yield. I yield. AAAH!»

Hal sees the

first of the

neighbourhood watch

Mrs Luhan, the muscular

wife of the blacksmith.

Coming into the kitchen.

Mrs Luhan gives a "don't

stop for me." wave.

«AAAA!» Screams Ratface

«Who sent you?» Lotta's

voice is low and menancing.

«I'll say nuffink!» Shouts

Ratface.

«I'll show you 'nothing'.

You think THIS hurts.

THIS is NOTHING! Here

it comes.» Says Lotta

with a smile.

«GAAAH! NOOOO! MUH!

MUH-Murdred. It was

MUH-Murdred sent me... AAAAH!»

Shouts Ratface.

«Liar. NO way. No ugly ratface

like you work for

Murdred. He's lads

are all pretty as dancing

girls.» Lotta keeps

squeezing.

«AAAH! I'm freelance.»

Gasps Ratface

out of breath, his

face contorts in pain.

«Let him go now,

Werlin's concert

is about to start.»

Says Hal, but too

late. Ratface's

eyes rolls up and

he goes limp. Lotta

let's him go.

«Neat, you put him

straight

to sleep.» Mrs Luhan

looks impressed.

«He bored me.» Says

Lotta.

«Murdred Huh?! What

if it's true? Can't

get worse than that.»

Says Hal.

«Yeah you two best

leave town for a while.»

Says Mrs Luhan.

Ratface is suddenly up, taking

a running jump

through the kitchen

window with a chrash

and a cheer from the

crowd outside.

«Drat, I guess he had

some secrets still

in him. Or he

wouldn't have

jumped. Oh hello

Werlin!» Says Hal.

«Hello again my

beauties! Is it

happening? Are you

listening?!» Says Werlin

with a huge smile under

his big, bushy, black mustach.

«Haven't I

told you to listen.

How can you listen

when you rudely

choke the man out? HMMM!»

Says Werlin.

Lotta looks at the

floor.

«Monstrous Murdred Huh?!

My, my, my. Murdred &

his merry mob of

malignants.

You best listen this

time or it'll be too

late. If Murdred and

his witch hunters gets

a shred of evidence

against you, your DONE.

Instead you'd better

be GONE.

I'll help you Leave.

But first

I gotta leave for

my concert.

See you

in your

yellow rooftop hut.

After my concert.

I'll get you

out of here.»

Werlin jogs out.

«Knock. BANG. Knock.»

«What now? Don't knock the door DOWN!» Says Lotta.

«Oh, hello it's you.»

Hal comes to the door

and sees the Lucas

from two houses down

the street.

«Our Ariadne sent us

a letter.»

Says mr Luca.

«That's good.»

Says Hal. Mrs

Luca sits down

on the floor,

bawling her eyes out.

Hal reaches

for the letter.

«Hal!» Lotta

shouts.

«Put the

kettle on,

that's a

dear.» Lotta thinks Hal rub

people the wrong way sometimes, like now.

«Look, there's

another letter

attached.» Says

mr Luca.

## The Ransom Note

Wanna see

Yer gurl?

Give us the

Treasure Map'o

Web-Dev

islands.

Best wishes X.

«Why'd the Lucas come to

Lotta & Hal

with that

ransom note?»

You ask. They are

Detectives Hal & Lotta,

Pirate Detectives.

Their neighbours bring

them cases to solve.

Hal feeds

the Lucas

ginger cookies

as they re-tell

their

tearful tale.

how little Ariadne

went out

to do a

morning

delivery of chocolate

croissants, never

to be seen again.

The Lucas are bakers.

Hal writes down the

address of the chocolate

croissant customer again.

The address

WAS near Southie.

Hal says nothing but

word on our Bridge is,

our lost lass

got kidnapped by

Southies Baddies.

Nor that

The watchmen

haven't

patrolled

into

Southie

for 12 years.

(missing card Our Lost Lassies)

«Leave it with us.» Hal

says to the Lucas.

«We'll find this

Treasure Map of

these so-called

'Web-Dev Islands'

&

we'll set up

an exchange, don't

you worry.»

«YESS! We've got

a new clue in our case!» Says Hal

when they are alone.

«And a tough one.»

Lotta says thoughtfully

tapping her

sharp right

front tooth.

«So what's our next

move?» Says Hal.

«Have you

ever heard

of these Web-

Dev Islands?» Says Lotta.

«Not a pip, but

why should I have?

the whole

PLACE

sounds insanely illegal,

"web-dev"! It's pure treason, innit?!» Hal says.

An explosion of roars

and wild clapping from

outside. Werlin starts singing.

«We can't leve now,

we finally got our

first clue in the

Ariadne case.» Says Hal.

«If Murdred gets us

locked up in the Tower

there's not much we

can do to find Ariadne.» Says Lotta.

«Yeah, that's another

thing. If we leave

now, that's like

CONFESSING we're guilty

of whatever Murdred is

trying to get us for.»

Says Hal.

«Yeah confession, Murdred's

favourite thing.» Says Lotta.

«And thirdly, sir Ector will

spank us if we leave his

house and his secrets

unguarded

when we promised to

protect all of it.» Says Hal.

«Bang. BANG-BANG-BANG bang bang!»

Hal opens and:

«AH! Good thing you

children are home,

cause you're staying

for a while. Here's

a warrant for your

house arrest. For

choking a mr Green

unconcious. The poor

innocent man is with

the surgeon as we speak.»

Says a sing-song-voice.

«Murdred.» Says Lotta icily.

«Werrreechz!» Sneers

the orange cat in

Murdred's face.

«Yuck! I hate cat

monsters.» Murdred jumps back, then struts

around with Werlin singing

outside the open door.

«Close that damn door,

the noise irks me.»

One of Murdred's

twelve thugs slams

the door.

«Any of you

traitors going to talk?»

Sneers Murdred.

Murdred picks up a kettle, sniffs it, drops it on

the floor. Takes a ladle and drops it.

«Weeeell I've got an

anonymous tip that you two

have been experimenting

treasonously with

web-dev witchcraft.

It's true isn't it?»

Says Murdred.

«No.» Says Hal.

«Ah. 'No' is it? So says every lying

traitor. But if I

find evidence, ...» Says

Murdred.

«We're Loyal to

Our Queen.» Says Hal.

«So you say. So you

SAY. HO-HO-HO who's

been a bad boy!? I spy

with my eye a banned

book.» Murdred stretches

up to the top shelf of the

kitchen bookcase and pulls

out a blue book. Swings it

in a wide arch, piruetting

like a dancer.

«JavaScript for Kids!

TRRRREASOOOON! MO-HA-

HA-HA! Write it down

notary.» Says Murdred.

The handsome notary scribbles

furiously on his parchment

a pink tip of tounge sticks

out.

The orange kitten bites Hals

hand, gets loose and flies at Murdred's

face, hugging it like a killer

kraken. Murdred stumbles

backwards clutching the

blue book to his chest.

His thugs backs off

horror on their faces. Smiling Lotta dances

forward snatches the blue book.

as Murdred trips to the floor.

«Run Forrest. RUUUN!» Lotta

shouts handing Hal the book. Hal sprints up the

stairs. Lotta takes the kitten calmly

by the scruff of it's neck

and lifts it towards the

thugs. One thug opens

the outer door and they

all back off.

Lotta takes a step closer.

«BOOO!» Shouts Lotta.

All the thugs run out the door.

Lotta walks calmly up

the stairs lika straight

gangster.

«Yooouuuu'll regreeet

thiiis!» Murdred's sing-

song-voice has a catch

in it.

«And you sound like a

lost

little lass.» Lotta says

over her shoulder.

Upstairs Hal has a wild look in

his eyes.

«You wanna stay? In house

arrest? Like a law abiding

citizen?» Says Lotta.

«We can't go. We need to

protect Sir Ector's house.»

Says Hal.

«Oh yeah! You smell that?

Smoke. From a fire.

Murdred has put fire to our

house. That's his way when

he has no proof. You know

it.» Says Lotta.

«We can put out the fire.»

Says Hal.

«Nobody puts out Murdred's

fires. He always brings

cartloads of house burning

materials. Our neighbours will be busy watering their own houses. Let's go up.» Says Lotta.

They climb the top secret

ladder to the rooftop.

«That's We Are the Champions,

it's Werlin's second to

last song.» Says Hal.

«Good thing I packed for

both of us, I see you've

packed nothing.» Says Lotta.

«I'm not going, I'm staying.

Ah hey Werlin! You're

already here!»

«Friends! Friends! I saw

Murdred roll up with two wagons, to fuel his fire.

So I made my drummer sing

the last song.» Says Werlin.

«I'm not going, I need to

find Ariadne.»

«I've got a tip for you,

The Merry Mermaid Pub

is the best place to

listen to tales of treasure

maps.» Says Werlin.

«The Merry Mermaid?

Never heard of that

pub.» Says Hal.

«I'll show you the way,

IF you decide to go.»

Says Werlin.

«You'll show us a place

were we might find the

treasure map of the

Web-Dev Islands?» Says Hal.

«Yes and much more

you've never seen before!»

Says Werlin.

«But what about sir

Ectors house?» Says Hal.

«You'll build a new

one with all that

treasure you'll find.»

Says Werlin.

«Yeah I'm ready for

a treasure hunt!» Hal

climbs into the yellow

and pink climbing ship

he built with Lotta

when he was younger.

«Oi! This is new!

'Break Glass In Case

of Treasure Hunt'»

Hal breaks glass.

«That looks like

a sword hilt!» Says

Lotta.

«Yeah it's an early

birthday gift.» Says

Werlin.

«Now what?» Says Hal.

«Now sweet Hal, you

pull the handle labeled

'Request'.» Says Werlin.

«Wait Hal, it's labeled

'Request (Do NOT pull

in case of fire)'» Says

Lotta.

«We've not a moment to

loose then, before the

fire reach us.» Says Hal.

«What does it do? WAIT!

HAL!» Shouts Lotta as

Hal pulls the 'Request'

lever.

«Yoouuuu'll seeeee!»

Shouts Werlin.

Like a loose tooth

coming out, the whole

climbing ship lurches

sideways and slides down

the sloping roof. A big,

black square opens in

the roof a bit further

down. They slide into

the darkness. And hit

sloshing water. Werlin

sings a wild wordless

melody at the top of

his voice. The darkness

turns red, then yellow,

orange. They're sloping

downwards. Faster back

to red. Yellow, orange.

Red. Yellow, orange.

Red. Yellow, orange.

Hal sees a black drop

ahead.

«On 'three' you breath in!

On 'one' you hold your

noses!» Werlin Shouts

over the splashing.

Hal wedges himself

with his butt into

a corner and his

legs to the wall.

Clutching the orange

cat, who is calm for

some reason.

Yellow, orange. red.

They shoot over the

edge without leaving

the water. Yellow, orange.

Red. Faster, faster. Down

ahead Hal sees a yellow,

orange and red cavern

zooming towards him.

Growing.

«Three!» Shouts Werlin.

Hal breaths in deeply.

He's soaked now.

«Two-ONE!» Shouts Werlin.

Hal holds his nose and

hides the cat's face

on his chest. They shoot

up the side of the cavern,

slows at the top and speed

down again. They hit in an

explosion of white water,

filling the climbing ship.

Slows down. Slides towards

a gaping boy in a black

bicorn hat. Eyes big and round.

They slide to a stop at an

old grey wooden pier.

The boy fumbles at his

belt and clumsily pulls

a rusty cutlass.

«S-s-s-stop! Please.

I mean, ALARM Aliens!»

Shouts the boy.

«No need for THAT lad,

we come in peace. Take

us to your larder.»

Says Werlin smiling warmly.

«I know how to use this!

Don't come closer.» Shouts

the boy with a scared voice.

«Not another of your pranks

Cisco, you woke me with

your splashing ruckus.

Oh MY! MY Oh MY!» A fat

little man stares at them.

«Where are your manners man.

You're supposed to toast

our safe landing in your

best rum.» Says Werlin

the closest Hal has

ever heard him to angry.

«Uhm-Ah ... awfully sorry

sir. I ... I'll get the

glasses in a jiffy. Cisco!

Put up that old cutlass,

do they look like aliens

to you?!» says the fat

little man and shuffles

of around the corner.

«Well ... Yes. Actually.»

Says the boy.

Hal steps onto the pier

and holds out his cat

towards the boy.

«Wanna hold her? Don't

be scared her name is

Jenny» Says Hal.

«It's a boy-cat.» Says

Lotta and walks past

the boy to stroke a

stack of pink towels,

printed with lettering,

neatly folded on a chair.

«It's a girl.» Says Hal

looking at his cat.

«Pretend to drink

the rum.» Whispers Werlin

out the side of his mouth.

«Here's the rum sir. Sorry

about our clumsiness.»

The man pours five tiny

glasses from a small,

brown barrel in the

crook of his arm. He

toasts with Werlin.

Lotta passes her glass

to the boy behind the

mans back.

«Thank you and have a

peacful watch.» Werlin says

and walks off toweling his

head with one of the

printed, pink towels.

«Uh ... Yeah, peacful.

Right. Of course.»

Mumbles the man.

«To the Merry

Mermaid then.» Says Hal.

«Yes. Welcome to

Tube Town.» Says Werlin

with his arms outstretch

and showing his crooked

teeth in a grand smile.

«You'll never find a

more wretched hive of

piracy and tall tales.

We must listen deeply

for clues among the lies.»

Inside the crowded & loud Merry Mermaid

«Hey! We don't serve

their kind here.» The

bartender points angrily

at Hal's cat.

«WHAT?!» Says Hal.

«Your feline! He'll have

to wait outside, we don't

want him here.» Says the bartender.

«It's a girl cat!» Says Hal,

but he finds a little hut

outside with water. Coming

inside again he bumps

into a hard shoulder

in the dim light.

«He doesn't like you.»

Says a scarred face.

«I'm sorry.» Says Hal.

«You watch yourself.

I have hanging sentences

on twelve islands.» Says

Scarface.

«I'll be carful then.»

Says Hal.

«You'll be dead!» Says

Scarface.

«YOU'll be dead!»

Says Lotta pointing

the sailors own

pistols at them.

«I'll give you a bullet

or a grog. Which will

it be? Bullet or grog?!»

Says Lotta calmly.

«I'll take the grog.»

The other sailor says.

«Keep your scarred buddy

away from me or he'll

get a round scar between his eyes.» Says

Lotta handing the sailor

two grogs from the bar.

«Yes miss. Thanks miss.

Bye miss.» Says the

other sailor.

«Humph!» Says Lotta and

drags Hal deeper into

the noisy Mermaid crowd. A

big beardy sailor points

them to the roaring fireplce

all the way in the back,

behind a bunch of actors

they see Werlin handing

out grogs from a tray

to a score of scruffy

sailors. Saying "sailors"

is not precise, proper pirates

is what they look like.

Werling gives Lotta and

Hal his 'shut-up-&-listen'

look. A rock hard

red head rappes her

now empty grog on

the table top and

lookes around the group

with half lidded eyes.

«Web-Dev Islands? Yeeeeah.

That's where Cap'n Crook

dug his treasure down.

Innit!?» Says the red head

and pulls a thumb-sized

wad of chewing tobacco

out of her jaw.

«Yall heard the one

about ol' Cap'n Crook?

How he aaalmooost lost

both his hands? Hmm?»

Says the red head.

«Noooo!» Shouts a

chorus of coarse voices.

Some banging on the table.

Both Hal and Lotta had heard

THAT terrible tale. But

Werlin watched them so

they listened in silence.

«He wasnae old back then, our

Cap'n Crook. Was he a

Captain?» Says the red head.

«Noooo!» Shouts are eager pirate pals.

She smiles wolfishly

and downs a grog she gets handed.

«A beardless cute, cook boy

and his name wasnae even

Crook! Mo-Ha-Ha-HA!» They all

join in the infectious laughter.

«We were boarding a frog

in the Biscay. A fair french

frigate. Blessedly legit,

mind you. We HAD the proper

paper work. The Kings writ

with red wax on it. Those

were the days my friends!»

Shouts the red head holding

her cup out while a

peg-legged pirate pours

grog sloppily.

«Horray! More Grog!

To the King! Down

with all frogs!» Shouts the

pirates and Werlin pours the pitcher.

«Aye, the bad, big Biscay.

The sun hid behind a

cloud blazingly fast

and a wind came up from

nowhere. Slapping our

ship around. Next thing our

Captain is down in the drink.

Captain Pan hisself, out cold.

Floating around. Helpless as

a babe in a Bahamas jungle.»

The red head empties her grog

and holds it out. And keeps talking.

«Lil' cook boy Crook

dived down and a white

shark surfaced straight

away. The boy punched

the shark straight on

the snout. And a surprised

shark it was. That shark

gave our boy a sulky

stare. Our boy didn't blink,

he stared straight back.

Holding his guard up lika pro.

And we got a line around

Captain Pan and hoisted him

outta the drink. He always was

a wee fairy-like thing our

Captain Pan. So we hoisted

him way to fast and hard.

Flew up he did. Booped his

head on the yardarm. We

booped him back to wakefulness.

Not a bit blissful about being

booped. The most creative

cursing I've heard before

or since. Aye our Captain

Pan had a piraty mouth

when he was in the mood for it.

Cook boy Crook looked up,

open mouthed. And THAT

was when a colossal

crocodile clamped it's

chops onto BOTH of Crooks

hands. Crook pulled the ONE

hand unstuck. Grabbed and

ripped the other arm loose.

We hoisted Crook up.

He lay down on deck.

With his arm aloft, held

by his other hand. Where

was his hand?»

«GOOONE!» Shouts the pirates.

«Datsright! GONE baby gone.

Blood was spraying up

in spurts and what did

Crook saaaay?»

Says the Red Head.

«Pardon me for laying down.»

Shouts the pirates.

«Datsright. Always polite

was Crook. 'That swim

took the wind outta my

sails.' he said. Pan

was grateful for

Crook guarding him

from the shark and

paying with his paw.

So on his deathbed Captain

Pan gave Crook a map.

A treasure map of the

Dead-Dev Islands. Or the

Web-Dev Islands as

people call them nowadays.

And THAT folks is how

it REALLY happened.»

## Våre savnede småjenter

Det er ikke bare fest og moro på brua vår. Sør for oss ligger Southie.

Og denne ene våren har 2 småjenter blitt borte fra brua vår.

«Ah, det er DERE.»
Hal slapp inn herr of fru Black fra to hus bortafor.

«Vår Ellen sendte oss et brev.»
Sa herr Black.
«Det er jo bra.» Sa Hal fru Black satt seg på gølvet og hylgrein.

«Yeah .... Let's go have some egg & bacon breakfast down at the Dolphin and see what gossip we can pick up about these 'Web-Dev Islands'.» I said

So Hal and I popped into the Dodgy Dolphin for a spot of breakfast. As always there was a loud group of musicians and actors drinking at the bar. We ignored them and went to the fireplace. A handfull of sailors were sitting close to the roaring fire. I say "sailors", but they were proper pirates. We knew them from the "Tarquin Todd case" last summer.

Hal & I brought the pirates a round of grog and a piece of paper with my sketchnoted Web-Dev Islands Treasure Map. Hal & I ate our bacon'n eggs in silence. It's a mistake to ask a question off of a pirate, she'll clam up. But shut up yourself and a pirate will start chatting like a magpie. Can't help herself. Silence is torture to a pirate. Uncle Walsingham told us that.

A hard looking redhead slammed her empty grog on the table.

«Yall heard the one about how ol'Cap'n Crook aaaalmost lost BOTH his hands?» She whispered huskily and pulled a great wad of chewing tobacco out of her upper jaw. I've heard several versions, but I wasn't worried because the tales were all GREAT.

«He wasnae old back then our Cap'n Crook. A beardless cook boy he was. We were boarding a french frigate in the Biscay. Totally legit mind you, we HAD the paperwork. The weather turned treacherous, slapping our ship around. Next thing Captain Pan hisself was down in the drink. Captain Pan floating around unconscious, helpless as a babe in a Bahamas jungle! Young Crook jumped right in after. And wouldn't you know it a shark showed up instantly. Some say Crook had read about the trick in a book, but anyway the boy punched that shark straight in the snout. The shark gave Crook an insulted stare to the count'o 10. Crook though, didn't blink. The boy stared right back into that sharky eye, holding his guard up lika pro. That gave the crew juuuust time enough to hoist Captain Pan» Said .
