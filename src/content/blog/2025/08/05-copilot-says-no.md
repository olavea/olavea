The audio file extension is used directly in the MIME type without validation. This could lead to incorrect MIME types if the extension doesn't match standard audio formats. Consider mapping extensions to proper MIME types.

Suggested change ```
                    <source src="{{ audio_file:url }}" type="audio/{{ audio_file:extension }}">
                    <source src="{{ audio_file:url }}"
                        {{ if audio_file:extension == "mp3" }}type="audio/mpeg"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "wav" }}type="audio/wav"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "ogg" }}type="audio/ogg"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "m4a" }}type="audio/mp4"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "aac" }}type="audio/aac"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "flac" }}type="audio/flac"
                        {{ elseif audio_file:extension == "webm" }}type="audio/webm"
                        {{ else }}type="application/octet-stream"
                        {{ /if }}>
                        ```


The MIME type 'audio/x-m4a' is non-standard. The standard MIME type for M4A files should be 'audio/mp4' or 'audio/m4a'.

Suggested change
mime_type: audio/x-m4a
mime_type: audio/m4a
