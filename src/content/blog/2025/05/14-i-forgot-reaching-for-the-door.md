I did my first user interview ðŸ¥³ for Galleon â›µ


**What:** Interviewing a potential Galleon â›µ user

**Why:** To learn about her:

- process
- problems
- tools

When working with user data


**How:**

I'm using @mjwhansen interview script template called "Customer Discovery Script". 

But if like me you haven't done user interviews yet, you'll be interested to know that it's normail that the interviewees:

**Save up their most crucial info for the last moment.**

Yeah, I didn't think about THAT! I didn't think about that before two days later, when I was re-reading Deploy Empathy. I saw the "Reaching For The Door" question again .... I was like "NOW I remember how the "Reaching For The Door" question opened my eyes when I first read the book.




And my next task was to Re-read Deploy Empathy


to understand how Webflow builders work with user data.

Weâ€™re building tools to make working with user data less of a mess for @webflow builders.
