I did my first user interview for Galleon â›µðŸ¥³

**What:** Interviewing a potential Galleon â›µ user. A visual developer.

**Why:** To learn about how she is working with user data and learn about her:

- process
- problems
- tools

When 


**How:**

I printed out [@mjwhansen's](https://x.com/mjwhansen) "Customer Discovery Script" template . 

But if like me you haven't done a user interview yet, you'll be interested to know that it's normal for interviewees to save up their most crucial info for the last moment.

## Yeah, I didn't think about THAT! 

I didn't think about that before two days later, when I was re-reading [Deploy Empathy](https://deployempathy.com/). Written by [@mjwhansen's](https://x.com/mjwhansen). I saw the "Reaching For The Door" question again .... I was like "NOW I remember how the "Reaching For The Door" question opened my eyes when I first read the book.



I Re-read Deploy Empathy and made this sketchNote in the breaks between helping out with the practice at Lillian's (10) cirkus practice. They'll have their big show soon.
