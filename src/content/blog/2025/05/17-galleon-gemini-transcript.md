When we're doing user interviews, we hunt for the exact words our users say. When someone mentions being "logged in" instead of "authenticated," that's goldâ€”it tells us how to write clearer documentation that actually connects with our customers.


But when I started reading the gemini-transcript of my second user interview I had to stop. I stopped reading, stood up and had to take a walk around our home office.

Queen Raae asked me "Are you okay?"

"What? No, I'm NOT okay. This AI-transcript is not word-for-word. It's some sort of AI-mumbo-jumbo summary. SOME of the words are the same... I'm Disappointed."

The fact was that I felt sorry for myself. I knew there were some golden treasures in the user interviews we've done, but my notes were incomplete.

This AI-summary was not helping me find the actual words they're using.

I walked off my the blackest part of my self pity, made a REAL strong cup of coffe and went back to work on Galleon.

Two days later I forced myself to look at the transcript again to warm up for that day's user interview..

And then when I was reading it, I noticed the sidebar in the Google doc. The first tab said "notes" the seecond tab said "transcript". I was reading the "notes" tab. I clicked on the "transcript" tab and I was like, oh, okay. HERE is the
word-for-word transcript. Smiling I kept on reading hunting for treasure.
