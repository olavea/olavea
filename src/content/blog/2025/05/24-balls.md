Now we're think maybe make a more minimal Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP) than we initially planned. Not only to test for Product-Market-Fit, but also to check for Product-Founder-Fit.

Product-Founder-Fit is important, make a product that fits your style of working and fits your life-style outside of work. If your own product doesn't fit you what is even the POINT!?

This more minimal Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP) will make our customers more independent of us. Meaning, if we close up shop our customers will still get 100% the same functionallity from our product. And THAT reduces the risk of Queen Raae feeling "trapped by the success of our new product" which is one of her great fears. We've know of her fear of success for years, but we got the idea for the solution in our third user interview. Our interviewee told us "NOT be trapped by the tool" was one important reason in picking ALL his tools for the customer portal he was building.
