## The Tale of the Plumber at the party 

At the party I met the Plumber, again. We talked last May 17th also. This time we started talking about famous debt collectors. Famous in Norway, that is. The Plumber said «We were doing work at so-and-so's house at Lindeberg.» Lindeberg is where I lived until I was six. It's urban, but by the woods.

## The Tale of the Bullet in the Bathroom

The Plumber and his apprentice started on one bathroom. The youngster pointed. «Doesn't that look like a bullet hole boss?» It did look like a bullet hole.  

«We'll soon find out, because we're taking that wall down today.» The Plumber said. They found the bullet, it was weirdly intact. The Plumber took the bullet and went looking for their client. The Plumber could hear the Client breathing in the living room. The Client was working a rowing machine in just blue jeans. The Client's upper body was muscled and scarred. With a few old, cheap tattos. The Client's face split into a smile when he saw the Plumber. 

«Do you wanna keep this?» The Plumber asked holding out his hand with the bullet. 

«Oh YES! And I could tell you the tale.» The Client said.

«Yes.» Said the Plumber, because the customer is always right.

## The Tale of the Bullet that didn't Kill in the Morning

Early morning. The Client is standing bare-chested in his bathroom. Peeing. Out of the corner of his eye something moves outside his little bathroom window.

The Client dodges left.

«Crack!» A bullet scrapes his right shoulder, blood spraying. (The Client points to his scarred shoulder.)

The Client is in the living room, running. The Client is flying out the second storey window. Landing awkwardly on scrapy shrubbery. Running bare-footed on the cold ground. Hustling up a wooded hillside. Digging himself down under old, cold leaves. Waiting. Heart beats calming down. Waiting. The blood getting cold, on his bare chest. Waiting. 

Digging himself out. Getting back inside the house. Checking every room. Looking at the surveilance video. Seeing three guys climbing up. Recognizing two faces. Making phone call.
