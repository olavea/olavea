## At the Big Cirkus Show Lillian (10) was The Magician

It was at a theater festival at a real theater stage downtown. We had the biggest truck full of props. We had costumes and make up. Lillian (10) liked her make up artist a lot. And after the show the make up artist's brother came out of the audience and said "You've got GREAT comedic timing!" to Lillian (10).
