## It Works!

**What:** I Found docs for deploying our Laravel Statamic site

**What for:** Feedback. We want ask potential users, creators and customers to visit Omway and give us actionable feedback .
or sign up for updates to build a plattform, community
from anywhere on the internet
 to push the app to a remote site early so we can
**Who for:** Potential users, creators and customers of Omway. Especially the creators of audio tours.

**How to:** 

- [x] I had a chat with Queen Raae yesterday in our courtyard ... Forge = no Laravel Cloud = no Sevalla = maybe db = maybe, link
- [x] Looked at Statamic Deploying Docs mmmm... Netlify How I wish you were here...
- [x] I quickly scanned https://docs.sevalla.com/applications/get-started/add-an-application 
- [x] Thought to myself "self, 💩 on reading these docs, Let's 
go down into the maze
learning by doing
do
make bugs, break some shit
 just try one servicedsf2321df. It's deploying what could possibly go wrong?"
- [x] I accepted Queen Raae's invitation to Sevalla
- [x] I now have a Sevalla account
- [x] "you can use one of the Sevalla one-click templates from your Dashboard." Doc says
- [x] I'll click the "Laravel" button under "Demon Applications" what could possibly go wrong?"

### I got mazed 🐮 and confused 

The deploy just started running with and example from a dude's github account. I stopped it. Deleted the Demon App and tried again. Off it goes like a Maze Runner. (I'll check out James Dashner's book now. Oops I bought the Maze Cutter, it was on sale minus 93% only $0.99. NOT procrastyinating at all! * )

Ok, my bad, I shouldn't have clicked THE "Demon Applications". I try again,"To add an application" says Doc 




- [x] Click Applications > Add application
- [x] Link a GitHub repository 
- [x] Choose a Default branch main

- [x] Resources: Choose the pod size Hobby because it's $5

Server error 500
SOMTHING happened

### I did suspect 
Sevalla is Kinsta 
APP_KEY

- [x] Click Environment variables

Iiiit woooorks 💪🥳🏴‍☠️
Time from "first coffee ☕" to "live app" = 1 hour 39 minutes
I play our audio, it works 
Our app LOOKS like 🐶💩
But I'm not squeamish 
I'll make myself another coffee, but htis time I'll use the aeropress I Dug out of the archeological dig that is the room-full of boxes containing our stuff that we will unpack once our house is refurbished. I've missed this little guy. I realized how much I missed him on this years camping trip to Shark Island with LIllian's classmates and parents. (link?)
also (link to youtube short?)
