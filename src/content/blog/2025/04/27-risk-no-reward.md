Let's say we KNEW social media would ruin the future lives our kids. Would we still risk allowing this reckless experiment to go on unsupervised?  

I love history, don't get me started on why. Instead let's examine a relevant situation from our past.

Back in the day, I was active in the environmental movement. Yeah I was one of THOSE youths.

We had this saying:

"No, we cannot PROVE that allowing increased polluting of our planet will make a more dangerous future. But neither are we willing to risk finding out by allowing the polluters to go on F.ing around unopposed."

Turned out the future proved us right. At least the people who will dispute we were right are fewer now.
