On our last day in Istanbul my lovely fiance and I and a Londoner from Finland shared a "disco limo" to the airport.

We were all pretty pooped from the inspiring, but intense convos with colorful founders. So I have no memory of how it came up, but our Finnish founder said:

"I was at a friends house last week and he served cupcakes with the coffee. Somebody said "These  cupcakes  are sooo tasty, you should start selling them!" But why? What's wrong with an unpaid hobby?"

Next day my lovely fiance and I and our daughter (10 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏) were watching the Taylor Swift album release movie in Oslo's best cinema. On screen Taylor's team is filming a music video and Taylor says to the camera. 


"This is an important day for me as a baker, my bread is going to be filmed soon and I've been adjusting it several times already."


Taylor Swift goes and adjusts the positioning of her beautifully crafted sourdough bread. I travel back in time to the cupcakes-unpaid-hobby-moment in the "disco limo".  I skip further back in time to the summer I was writing a movie script just for fun in our summer house on the Swedish gold coast. "There you go! Your unpaid hobby." 

And then I'm pulled back into the whirlwind of dancing girls and dancing pirates and a drowning princess in rolling waves on screen
