## How do I Add Intensity to my Coding Practice?

- Mindfullness

## Dr. Guy Windsor's five tips for Mindful Skill-building 

1. If you're not building ONE skill, you're not mindful.
2. If your practice is not demanding absoulute limit of your concentration and skill, you're not mindful.
3. If your practice is not generating measurable improvements, you're not mindful.
4. If your practice is not tiring, frustrating and painful, you're not mindful.
5. If your practice highlights your EVERY weakness and helps you stengthen your skill efficently and deeply, then it is, must be mindful.

## Let's see how I did while practicing my rock climbing mindfulness.  

Dr. Guy Windsor's five tips:

1. ✅ I'm building ONE skill 
2. ✅ I was at my absoulute limit of my concentration and skill 
3. ✅ I did generate measurable improvements 
4. ✅ My practice was tiring, frustrating and painful
5. Not sure if my practice highlighted my EVERY weakness and helped me stengthen my skill efficently and deeply

So that's FOUR out of five, not shabby, not shabby at all!
