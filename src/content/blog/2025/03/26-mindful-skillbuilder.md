## Practicing my Mindfullness while Climbing

For me, a great way to practice mindfulness is indoor rock climbing. I do it by placing my foot slowly and deliberatly on the foothold. Let's see if I can use some of Dr. Guy Windsor's five tips while practicing my rock climbing mindfulness.  

## Dr. Guy Windsor's five tips for Mindful Skill-building 

1. If you're not building ONE skill, you're not mindful.
2. If your practice is not demanding absoulute limit of your concentration and skill, you're not mindful.
3. If your practice is not generating measurable improvements, you're not mindful.
4. If your practice is not tiring, frustrating and painful, you're not mindful.
5. If your practice highlights your EVERY weakness and helps you stengthen your skill efficently and deeply, then it is, must be mindful.
