## Practicing my Mindfullness while Climbing

## Dr. Guy Windsor's five tips for Mindful Skill-building 

1. If you're not building ONE skill, you're not mindful. Multitasking is mindless.
2. If your practice is not demanding absoulute limit of your concentration and skill, you're not mindful.
3. If your practice is not generating measurable improvements, you're not mindful.
4. If your practice is not tiring, frustrating and painful, you're not mindful.
5. If your practice highlights your EVERY weakness and helps you stengthen your skill efficently and deeply, then it is, must be mindful.
