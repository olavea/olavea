## Your Life Has Too Many Mindless Moments

- Mindless moments with your kids
- Mindless moments at work
- Mindless moments in your relationships
- Mindless moments fueling your addiction

Pick one of the above situations that resonates with your life. Or add your own situation.

## Imagine Yourself More Mindfull in that Situation 

Imagine yourself in the situation where you know your mindless, but being mindful instead. How will your kid react? Your boss? Your spouse? Your friend? Your drinking buddy? 

## Start A New Life Story

I have tested this doable way to play around with purpose and then added a purpose to my life. 

**What:** Start out on writing A New Life Story, but with purpose

**Why:** Adding a Life's purpose makes it easier for you to be mindful in those moments where you're now mindless

**How:** Six steps of mainly writing for about 1 hour. Difficulty level 2 out of 5.

## Step 1 Capture Ideas For YOUR Life's Purpose

- Observe your thoughts
- Identify and capture ideas

Write down EVERYTHING that pops into your head. üó£Ô∏è
Set a timer at 9 minutes. ‚è≤Ô∏è


## Step 2 Pick One Purpose, Quickly

- Read through your notes
- Pick one purpose

Set a timer at 1 minute. ‚è≤Ô∏è

## Step 3 Write down Bullet Point ideas ...

... for how your life looks after some initial success. Working towards that Purpose you just picked. See step 1 for rules. Set a timer at 23 minutes. ‚è≤Ô∏è

Is your mumbo-jumbo-alarm ringing? üîî Ding DonG! Let me ask you this: What's the cheapest and easiest way to test if this purpose you picked is for you? Wriiiting? Do it, read through the bullet point ideas, is this the life you want? 

## Step 4 Review Your Picked Life's Purpose

Read through the bullet point ideas, is this the life you want? 
Set a timer at 3 minutes. ‚è≤Ô∏è

If this is not the life you want, go back to step 1, it should be easier now, set a shorter timer. Pick another purpose in step 2.
 
What to look for? You don't need a "Heck Yeah!" purpose. What you're looking for is a purpose with a PROBABLE end game that MILDLY motivates you. Remember, the "WHY" of this excersise is: 

Adding a Life's purpose makes it easier for you to be mindful in those moments where you're now mindless.

Or to make a few of your other moments more mindful. 

It's free. It's not hard. And you can change your mind later. What can you loose?! Invest an hour today and see your life become less mindless!


## Step 5 Pick One Life Purpose, Write it Wown



## Step 6 Find Ways to remind Yourself of Your Purpose

Especially in situations you know you can be mindless.
