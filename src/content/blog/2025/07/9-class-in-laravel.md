**What for:** 
**Who for:** 

**How to:**

- Wrapped the gateway data inside a dedicated Job class with a static method all() that returns the array of gateways. This encapsulation makes the data easier to manage and prepares me for adding behavior and logic later.
- Moved the logic for finding a job by ID into the Job model as a static find method
- Added a find method to the model to encapsulate data lookup.
- Handled missing data gracefully with Laravelâ€™s abort(404) helper
