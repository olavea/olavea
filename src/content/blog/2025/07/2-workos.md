I was the ship's cat of the German battleship Bismarck. When the ship was sunk in Norway in 1941, only 116 crew members of over 2,200 survived. I was picked up by the destroyer HMS Cossack, one of the ships responsible for destroying the Bismarck. 

Cossack herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October 1941, killing 159 of her crew, but I survived again! I was rescued and taken to Gibraltar. I became the ship's cat of HMS Ark Royal, which was torpedoed and sunk in November that year. I was again rescued, but I got a home on land. By now people called me "Unsinkable Sam" because I survived those three ship sinkings. 

I was given a new job as shore duty mouse-catcher in the office buildings of the Governor of Gibraltar because I still had "six lives to go". Later I travelled to the UK and spent the rest of my life at the 'Home for Sailors'.
