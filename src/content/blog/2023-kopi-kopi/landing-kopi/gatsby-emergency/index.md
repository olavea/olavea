## Imagine getting the help you need

Imagine this – Imagine getting pulled off the reef without damage. Imagine your Gatsby navigation skills improving. Imagine having the confidence that you'll stay clear of the reef the next time around.

## Speak with a seasoned Gatsby developer

Get Unstuck – Often, all it takes to get unstuck is to talk to the right person at the right time. A person who has experience sailing around the Gatsby waters and probably has experience with that same reef, or at least a very similar reef.

## Here's How It Works

You book an Emergency Gatsby Call with me using [my scheduling link](https://savvycal.com/raae/emergency). The event is 60 minutes, but you might want to block out extra time in case we go a little long. Our call will take place over Whereby. When booking, I'll ask you to give me a quick rundown of your troubles and your tech stack.

### 100% Money back guarantee

If I cannot help you find a way to get off your reef, I'll refund your payment in full.

### Availability is limited

I'm only available for a couple live Gatsby calls per week. Scheduling is first-come, first-served, so the sooner you book your call, the sooner you'll get into clear waters again.
